## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Challenge

### âœ… **Challenge 1: Deploy GPTâ€‘2 Fully on ICP**

**Task:**  
Deploy the GPTâ€‘2 model on the Internet Computer blockchain using the example integration by DecideAI. This project implements GPTâ€‘2 inference on ICP, providing a straightforward way to deploy and interact with the model.

#### What Youâ€™ll Do:
- **Set Up the Model:**  
  Use DecideAIâ€™s GPTâ€‘2 integration to deploy the model as an ICP canister.
- **Process AI Responses:**  
  Implement inference calls that process user input and generate text based on the GPTâ€‘2 model.
- **Analyze Computational Costs:**  
  Explore the instruction counts and performance metrics based on varying input and generation lengths.

#### ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Refer to the DecideAI integration repository for detailed instructions:  
  [DecideAI - GPTâ€‘2 on ICP](https://github.com/decide-ai/decide-ai-ic/tree/main/examples/gpt2)
- Review the provided analysis on instruction counts and performance to understand computational costs.
- Experiment with different input lengths and generation parameters to optimize performance.

### âœ… **Challenge 2: Implement an AI Agent with Blockchain Tools**

**Task:**  
Develop an AI agent that uses the **OpenAI GPT-4o Mini API** for processing natural language commands while integrating with the **ICP blockchain** to query balances and execute transfers. This implementation does **not** require a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for simplicity.

#### What Youâ€™ll Do:
- **Implement an AI Agent:**  
  Utilize the Anda framework to build an agent capable of handling blockchain interactions.
- **Enable ICP Ledger Interactions:**  
  Add tools to query account balances and execute token transfers on the ICP blockchain.
- **Process AI Commands:**  
  Allow users to interact with the agent via text-based inputs to retrieve blockchain-related information.

#### ðŸ”§ **Anda Framework Configuration**
Before running your AI agent, make sure to add the following lines to your `.env` file:
```
MODEL_NAME='gpt-4o-mini'
MODEL_ENDPOINT='https://api.openai.com/v1'
```
To obtain the **OpenAI API Key**, please DM **Tiago or Antoine**. We have prepared keys specifically for this challenge.

For authentication, the **ID_SECRET** and **ROOT_SECRET** can be directly derived from one of your existing `dfx` identities. You can do this by specifying the path to your selected identity `.pem` file. For example, to use the principal address of your **default** identity, run:
```
./target/debug/anda_engine_cli agent-run -i ~/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem -p 'Please check my PANDA balance'
```

### âœ… **Challenge 3: Build an AI Agent Using the Eliza Framework**

**Task:**  
Develop an AI agent using the **Eliza framework** that interacts with an **Ethereum wallet deployed on ICP**. The AI agent should be able to securely request and process transactions following pre-configured security rules.

#### What Youâ€™ll Do:
- **Deploy an Eliza-based AI Agent:**  
  Utilize the Eliza framework to build an agent capable of interacting with an Ethereum wallet on ICP.
- **Securely Request Transactions:**  
  Implement a system where the AI agent can **request** but not directly execute transactions.
- **Apply Security Rules:**  
  Enforce **limits on transactions** (e.g., max transaction amount, cooldown periods).
- **Monitor and Control the AI Agent:**  
  Provide a UI for users to **manage wallet security rules** and revoke access if necessary.

#### ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Watch the **demo video** explaining the AI-agent and Ethereum wallet integration:  
  ðŸŽ¥ [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eql_qSas3so)
- Use the **Eliza Ethereum wallet plugin** for interacting with Ethereum on ICP:
