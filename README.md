## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Challenge

### âœ… **Challenge 1: Deploy GPTâ€‘2 Fully on ICP**

**Task:**  
Deploy the GPTâ€‘2 model on the Internet Computer blockchain using the example integration by DecideAI. This project implements GPTâ€‘2 inference on ICP, providing a straightforward way to deploy and interact with the model.

#### What Youâ€™ll Do:
- **Set Up the Model:**  
  Use DecideAIâ€™s GPTâ€‘2 integration to deploy the model as an ICP canister.
- **Process AI Responses:**  
  Implement inference calls that process user input and generate text based on the GPTâ€‘2 model.
- **Analyze Computational Costs:**  
  Explore the instruction counts and performance metrics based on varying input and generation lengths.

#### ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Refer to the DecideAI integration repository for detailed instructions:  
  [DecideAI - GPTâ€‘2 on ICP](https://github.com/decide-ai/decide-ai-ic/tree/main/examples/gpt2)
- Review the provided analysis on instruction counts and performance to understand computational costs.
- Experiment with different input lengths and generation parameters to optimize performance.
